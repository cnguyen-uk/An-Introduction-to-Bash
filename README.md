# An Introduction to Bash
*A compact introduction to using Bash.*

The command line is a text interface which takes in commands for the computer’s operating system to run. It can be used to work through files and folders on the computer, run programs, and write powerful scripts to automate tasks. Bash (or shell) scripting is a great way to execute frequently used sets of commands.

The commands here are for unix-based systems, but most of them will also work in Windows PowerShell.

This guide is far from comprehensive and does not aim to be. Although not necessary, it will be helpful to be familiar in at least one programming language, especially for the [Bash Scripting](#bash-scripting) section.

Throughout, note that file or directory arguments for commands can also be replaced with absolute or relative paths instead.

## File System Navigation

Here are some common navigation commands:

```Bash
ls  # Lists the files and folders inside the current directory
ls -a  # Option to list all contents, including hidden contents
ls -l  # Option to list all contents in long format
ls -t  # Option to order files and directories by modified time
ls -alt  # Options can be combined
```

```Bash
pwd # Prints the working directory
```

```Bash
cd directory/  # Changes directory
cd ..  # Moves up one directory
```

## File System Manipulation

Commands can be used to copy, move and remove files and directories.

```Bash
mkdir directory_name  # Makes a directory in the current directory
```

```Bash
touch file_name.ext  # Creates a new file in the current directory
```

```Bash
cp file file_copy  # Destructively copies file to file_copy
cp file1 file2 destination_directory/  # Copies file1 and file2
cp * destination_directory/  # Wildcard to copy all files
cp m*.txt destination_directory/  # Typical wildcard usage
```

```Bash
mv file1 file2  # Renames file1 to file2 (destroys if file2 exists)
mv file1 file2 destination_directory/  # Moves file1 and file2
# Typical wildcard usage can also be used to move, similar to cp.
```

```Bash
rm file  # Permanently removes a file
rm -r directory/  # Uses recursion to remove a directory completely
```

## Redirection

Operators can be used to redirect the input and output (I/O) of a command to and from other files and programs, or even to chain commands together in a pipeline.

The three I/O connections are:
- Standard input (*stdin*): the source for a command, such user keyboard input into the terminal. Note that this is not the same as the arguments accepted by a command.
- Standard output (*stdout*): the output of a command.
- Standard error (*stderr*): an error message outputted by a failed command.

The following commands will be useful for redirection:

```Bash
echo "Hello"  # Outputs to the terminal the string used as the input
```

```Bash
cat file  # Outputs to the terminal the contents of a file
cat file1 file2  # Outputs the concatenation of the files
```

The `>` operator redirects the stdout of the left to a file on the right, which gets overwritten.

```Bash
echo "Hello" > hello.txt  # The file hello.txt contains "Hello"
cat hello.txt > greet.txt  # The file greet.txt contains "Hello"
```

The `>>` operator redirects the stdout of the left to a file on the right, which gets appended to.

```Bash
echo "Goodbye" >> greet.txt
# The file greet.txt now contains "Hello Goodbye"

cat greet.txt >> hello.txt
# The file hello.txt now contains "Hello Hello Goodbye"
```

The `<` operator redirects the file on the right as the stdin of the command on the left. This is useful in situations where a program requires user input but testing by the usual stdin is tedious. Instead, we can use a file containing the test input as the stdin through the `<` operator. Moreover, it allows for the testing of all of the input at once.

```Bash
program < test_input.txt
```

The `|` operator “pipes” the stdout of the left to a command on the right, which takes it as the stdin. Multiple | operators can be chained together.

```Bash
cat hello.txt | wc | cat > count.txt
# The file count.txt contains “1 3 20”. Note that without piping,
# the wc command will output the word count and the filename.
cat hello.txt | wc > count.txt  # Alternate way of doing the above
```

Two common commands to pipe together are `sort`, which takes a file as its stdin and orders it alphabetically as its stdout; and `uniq`, which takes a file as its stdin and filters out adjacent, duplicate lines as its stdout.

```Bash
sort file.txt | uniq > unique_file.txt
```

## Other Useful Commands

The `grep` (global regular expression print) command searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results.

```Bash
grep -i word file.txt  # The -i option enables case insensitivity
```

The command can also be used on a directory to return files which contain matches. 

```Bash
grep -R word directory/  # The -R option returns filenames with lines
grep -Rl word directory/  # The -Rl option returns only filenames
```

The `sed` (stream editor) command modifies stdin based on an expression, then returns this as output. It is similar to “find and replace” but is more powerful when used with regular expressions.

```Bash
sed s/word/replace/g file.txt
# Substitutes "word" with "replace", globally
```

The `less` command is similar to the `cat` command but is better suited for handling larger files. It displays files in the terminal one page at a time. It can also be configured within a bash profile (discussed later on) through the `LESS` environment variable. Setting it equal to the `"-N"` option will add line numbers to the file.

```Bash
less largefile.txt
```

The `history` command returns history information on commands previously used.

```Bash
history
```

The `clear` command clears the terminal window.

```Bash
clear
```

The `man` command returns a manual for a command.

```Bash
man command
```

## Environment

Each terminal session is loaded with settings and preferences that form the command line environment. It is possible to configure the environment to support custom commands, programs, and variables to be shared across sessions.

One way to modify the environment is through a command line text editor, such as nano (or notepad on Windows).

```Bash
nano file.txt  # Opens nano and opens or creates file.txt
```

The bash profile, a file which stores environment settings, is called `~/.bash_profile`. The contents of this will be loaded at the start of every session. Modifications typically follow the following lines of command:

```Bash
nano ~/.bash_profile  # Opens the bash profile for modification
source ~/.bash_profile  # Makes changes available for this session
```

Within the bash profile, we can make various modifications, which we discuss below, all of which are implicitly done in the `~/.bash_profile` file itself (and not the terminal session).

The `alias` command allows for the creation of aliases for commands. We must use the following syntax (including no spaces), otherwise an error will be thrown:

```Bash
alias pd="pwd"  # Now pd can be used to print working directory
alias ll="ls -la"  # Now ll can be used as a shortcut for ls -la
```

The `export` command allows for the configuration of environment variables.

```Bash
export USER="John Smith"
```

If we want to check the value of a variable, we can echo the variable, prefixed with `$`. 

```Bash
echo $USER  # Returns John Smith
```

The following are some other commonly configured environment variables:

```Bash
export PS1=">>"  # Changes the default command prompt to >>
export HOME="path"  # The home directory path can be changed, if necessary
export PATH="path" 
# Contains all directories which contain command line scripts.
# In advanced cases we can edit this if we add our own scripts.
```

The `env` (environment) command returns a list of all of the environment variables for the current user.

```Bash
env  # This list will be quite long, but we can also use grep
env | grep PATH  # Returns the value of the PATH variable
```

## Bash Scripting

Any command that can be run in the terminal can be run in a bash script. As with any programming language, there are conventions to follow:

- Bash scripts have `.sh` as their file extension.
- The beginning of each script file should start with `#!/bin/bash` on its own line. This tells the computer to use bash as the interpreter.
- Script files should be placed in the `~/bin/` directory, as a matter of good practice. (We may need to add this directory to the `PATH` variable by adding `PATH=~/bin:$PATH` to the bash profile configuration file.)

We also need to give script files the “execute” permission.

```Bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

To declare a variable, we use the following syntax:

```Bash
variable="value"
```

To access the value of a variable, we prefix the variable name with the `$` operator.

```Bash
echo $variable  # Returns "value" to the terminal
```

Conditionals use the following syntax (ensure that the spacing for square brackets is as also as shown):

```Bash
if [ condition1 ]
then
    statement1
elif [ condition2 ]
then
    statement2
else
    statement3
fi
```

For numbers, Bash has the usual comparison operators: `-eq`, `-ne`, `-le`, `-lt`, `-ge`, `-gt`, `-z`.
For strings, the comparison operators are: `==`, `!=`. The logical operators are: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
For string comparisons, it is best practice to use double quotation marks to prevent errors in the case of spaces or null values.

```Bash
if [ "$word1" == "$word2" ]  # Checks if these strings are equal
```

Note that arithmetic in bash scripting uses the following syntax:

```Bash
variable=$((variable + 7))
```

There are three different loops: `for`, `while` and `until`.

```Bash
for word in $paragraph
do
    statement
done
```

```Bash
while [ condition ]
do
    statement
done
```

```Bash
until [ condition ]
do
    statement
done
```

We can allow scripts to access external data. There are three main ways to do this.

The first is by using the `read` command, which prompts the user for input.

```Bash
read number  # Saves the user’s input to the variable "number"
read -p "Enter your age: " number  # Option to specify prompt text
```

The second is by calling the script with input arguments.

```Bash
script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
# Referenced positionally in the script using $1, $2, $3.
# If any number of input arguments is allowed, then use $@.
```

The third way is by accessing external files.

```Bash
files=/directory_path/*  # Accesses all files in directory_path
```

For convenience, we can use our bash profile to create an alias for calling bash scripts.

```Bash
alias short='./longname.sh'  # Now short calls the script
alias short='./longname.sh "arg"'  # Including a first input
```
